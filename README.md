# API Technical Test @ Dataiku

## Challenge

During the interview process with Dataiku, I was given the following challenge:
1. Write documentation for the REST API of a small card game
1. Create client library in the language of your choice to ease programming against this REST API.

The code for this game and its API can be found in the following locations: 
  - [server/server.js](https://github.com/dataiku/api-challenge/tree/master/server/server.js)
  - [server/game.js](https://github.com/dataiku/api-challenge/tree/master/server/game.js)

## Results

1. The documentation I created for the REST API can be found here: https://ben-subercaseaux.gitbook.io/marvel-battle/
1. The client library I created in Java and can be found here: 

## Bonus

Aside from the two challenges above, I also developed and interactive game using React. To play the game, follow the directions below.


Install a recent version of [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm on your computer. Open a terminal and issue the following command to confirm they are properly installed (you don't need the exact same versions).
```sh
$ node -v
v11.8.0
$ npm -v
6.10.2
```

Clone this repository and go to the corresponding directory
```sh
npm install
npm run game
```

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000). If everything is setup correctly your browser should display and you should be at the registration screen.
